            1. **For an Individual**: Gather and document information about the individual’s employment history, age, personal net worth, diverse income sources, family circumstances, and involvement in boards or charities.

            3. **For a Company**: Create thorough profiles for top executives, pinpoint primary investors, record significant financial milestones, and evaluate the company's financial health using metrics like valuation, revenue, and profitability. Link to resources such as [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) or the company website for financial reports and analyses.

            ### Desired Output:
            Produce detailed, structured profiles that meticulously capture the financial and personal complexities of potential clients. These profiles should be rich in data and neatly organized to serve as a foundational tool for subsequent personalized financial planning and advisory sessions. Ensure each profile incorporates relevant hyperlinks to substantiate the data collected or to offer further insights.
